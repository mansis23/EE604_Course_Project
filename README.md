The deepfake detection model proposed in
this study is a dual-branch neural network architecture that
combines EfficientNet (a pre-trained convolutional neural
network) with a handcrafted feature extraction branch. This
dual-branch structure aims to enhance detection performance by leveraging both high-level feature representations
from a deep learning model and specific handcrafted statistical features, creating a more comprehensive approach
to identify deepfake images. Our model was trained and
evaluated on a comprehensive dataset of real and deepfake
photos
